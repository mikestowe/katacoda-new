Great job!  Now let's start writing our code!

First, find the code under the **Create and Edit sms.php** section of the SMS quickstart.  Select the entire code block, and copy it.

Now open sms.php in the editor (top right): `sms.php`{{open}}

Finally, paste the code you copied, in it's entirety into the code editor.
