Great job!  Now let's create our PHP file where we'll place the code.

First create the file by typing:

`vi sms.php`{{execute}}

Find the code under the **Create and Edit sms.php** section of the SMS quickstart.  Select the entire code block, and copy it.

`/var/www/html/sms.php`{{open}}

Now, to switch to edit more, press `i`{{execute}} and then paste the code into the terminal window (CTRL-V or Command-V).

Finally, hit `escape` and type `:wq`{{execute}} to save your file and exit from the code view.
