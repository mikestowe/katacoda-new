Welcome to the interactive SMS demo for PHP.  Before you get started, please make sure you have created a Developers account and app on RingCentral Developers.

**If you haven't already signed up and created an app, you can do so by [clicking here](https://developer.ringcentral.com/new-app?name=SMS+Quick+Start+App&desc=A+simple+app+to+demo+sending+an+SMS+on+RingCentral&public=false&type=ServerOther&carriers=7710,7310,3420&permissions=SMS,ReadMessages&redirectUri=&utm_source=devguide&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=quickstart)**

Once you have created your app and have your app and sandbox credentials, click "Start scenario."
